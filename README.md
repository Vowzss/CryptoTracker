# CryptoTracker
</div>

**CryptoTracker is a discord bot made to display as much crypto currency pair prices as possible.**<br/>

# Installation
First of all you need to install Java 8.<br/>
Then you can drag and drop **"CryptoTracker.jar"** inside your folder of choice.<br/>

# Run
```
java -jar CryptoTracker.jar
```
You can also use a session manager to make your bot run 24h/24.<br/>
A good tool called tmux (only working on linux OS) -> https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/.<br/>

# Usage
Display is done automatically, though you can have a look at the bot's stats by using the command.<br/>
```
/stats
```

# Configuration
This is how the configuration looks like.<br/>

![](screenshots/config_default_exemple.png?raw=true "Default Config Exemple")
![](screenshots/config_custom_exemple.png?raw=true "Custom Config Exemple")

You have two exemples:
- on the left, the default configuration that you will have to fill up with your informations.<br/>
- on the right, a custom configuration (without bot token for security reasons).<br/>

The configuration is pretty self-explanatory:
* `token`: your bot token generated when creating an app on (https://discord.com/developers/applications).<br/>
* `symbol`: ***PAIR1*** is the crypto you want to track and ***PAIR2*** is it's reference price<br/> 
    -> (BTCUSDT) as an exemple means you are tracking BTC price according to the USDT price.<br/> 
* `crypto`: ***PAIR1*** is the crypto you want to track<br/> 
* `owner_id`: your personal id on discord (optional).<br/> 
* `decimal`: decimal displayed on the price. (refer to "Tracking Exemples").<br/> 
    -> **4** as an exemple means with pair ***BTCUSDT*** : "***6185***"<br/> 
    -> **1** as an exemple means with pair ***LTCUSDT*** : "***9***"<br/>
